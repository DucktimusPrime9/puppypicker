	<h2><A href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pembroke-welsh-corgi/" alt="AKC: Pembroke Welsh Corgi">Corgi</A></h2>
	<img src="images/corgi.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Corgi"/><br><p>At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day’s work. Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings.</p>

	<h2><A href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bernese-mountain-dog/" alt="AKC: Bernese Mountain Dog">Bernese Mountain Dog</A></h2>
	<img src="images/bernese.jfif" width="400" height="400" alt="Bernese"/><br><p>The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, sturdy worker who can stand over 27 inches at the shoulder. The thick, silky, and moderately long coat is tricolored: jet black, clear white, and rust. The distinctive markings on the coat and face are breed hallmarks and, combined with the intelligent gleam in the dark eyes, add to the Berner’s aura of majestic nobility. A hardy dog who thrives in cold weather, the Berner’s brain and brawn helped him multitask on the farms and pastures of Switzerland.</p>

    <h2><A href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/german-shepherd-dog/" alt="AKC: German Shepherd">German Shepherd</A></h2>
    <img src="images/gs-puppy.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="German Shepherd"/><br>
    <p>German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but GSDs can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds.</p>

	<h2><A href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/shih-tzu/" alt="AKC: Shih Tzu">Shih Tzu</A></h2>
	<img src="images/Shih-Tzu.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Shih Tzu"/><br>
    <p>Shi Tsu (pronounced in the West "sheed-zoo" or "sheet-su"; the Chinese say "sher-zer"), weighing between 9 to 16 pounds, and standing between 8 and 11 inches, are surprisingly solid for dogs their size. The coat, which comes in many colors, is worth the time you will put into it - few dogs are as beautiful as a well-groomed Shih Tzu.</p>

	<h2><A href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/miniature-american-shepherd/" alt="AKC: ">Miniature American Shepherd</A></h2>
	<img src="images/miniature-american-shepherd.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Miniature American Shepherd"/><br>
    <p>The Miniature American Shepherd shares many physical traits with its forebear the Australian Shepherd—only on a smaller scale. Females stand between 13 and 17 inches at the shoulder; males range from 14 to 18 inches. Despite their size, Minis are every inch a true herding dog: energetic, versatile, rugged, and extremely bright. The eye-catching coat comes in black, blue merle, red, and red merle. (The merle will exhibit in any amount marbling, flecks, or blotches.) Minis move with the smooth and agile step of a dog built for hard work on punishing terrain.</p>

	<h2><A href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/" alt="AKC: Golden Retriever">Golden Retriever</A></h2>
	<img src="images/Golden-Retriever.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Golden Retriever"/><br>
	<p> The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a "merry action.</p>

	<h2><A href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/boston-terrier/" alt="AKC: Boston Terrier">Boston Terrier</A></h2>
	<img src="images/Boston Terrier.jpeg" width="400" height="400" alt="Boston Terrier"/><br>
	<p>Boston Terriers are compact, short-tailed, well-balanced little dogs weighing no more than 25 pounds. The stylish <q>tuxedo</q> coat can be white and either black, brindle, or seal (dark brown). The head is square, the muzzle is short, and the large, round eyes can shine with kindness, curiosity, or mischief. Ever alert to their surroundings, Bostons move with a jaunty, rhythmic step.</p>

	<h2><A href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/" alt="AKC: Labrador Retriever">Labrador Retriever</A></h2>
	<img src="images/Labrador Retriever.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Labrador Retriever"/><br>
	<p>The Labrador Retriever is a strongly built, medium-sized, short-coupled, dog possessing a sound, athletic, well-balanced conformation that enables it to function as a retrieving gun dog; the substance and soundness to hunt waterfowl or upland game for long hours under difficult conditions; the character and quality to win in the show ring; and the temperament to be a family companion. Physical features and mental characteristics should denote a dog bred to perform as an efficient Retriever of game with a stable temperament suitable for a variety of pursuits beyond the hunting environment.</p>
